# SurfacePress

A starter theme for WordPress for rapid setup and ease of editing.

Currently using Foundation 6.5.3.

## Getting started

The setup is the same as installing any standard WordPress theme.

Please edit `assets>scripts>scripts.js`, `assets>styles>custom.css` and `functions>enqueue-scripts.php` as required.

The default nav template is `parts>nav-default.php`, the other navs in this folder are unedited from the JointsWP original files.

## Comes pre-installed with/uses

* [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) -- The web framework
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) -- Optimal settings for custom fonts
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) -- For easy icon fonts
* [Cookie Consent](https://cookieconsent.osano.com/) -- Cookie law popup

## Accessibility options

Already integrated with a accessibility options system, which uses [js cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie) to set data-attributes on the `body` tag, with (basic) coresponding css.

## Notes

* Please use [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to generate a custom favicon, and replace the files in the theme root directory
